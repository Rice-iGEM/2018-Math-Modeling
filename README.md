Metabolic/translation modeling using MATLAB
The file "cell_modeling.m" contains all the functions necessary for the model and instructions for using it.
The model used is based on https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02898-6 ("Dynamic allocation of orthogonal ribosomes facilitates uncoupling of co-expressed genes", Darlington et al., Nature Communications, 2018).
The model simulates nutrient import, substrate-to-energy conversion, ribosome formation, and translation using a non-linear system of ODEs (ordinary differential equations).
